# Scenario Analysis 


The purpose of this feature is to add the ability to shock various things in the portfolio, 
initially just individual stocks and sectors, but eventually things like geographic region, 
or combinations.  Also, we'd like an LLM to be able to determine how a shock to the 
drivers of economies, like GDP, will affect the portfolio and create a shock.

We will take a phased approach, the goal is for a LLM to eventually be able to create these 
scenarios.



## Phase A 
*   Shock individual entities 
*   Shock sectors 


## Phase B
*   Have an LLM take in a sentence of natural language and create a scenario from that.
